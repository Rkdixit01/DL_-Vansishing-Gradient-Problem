# Vanishing Gradient Problem in Deep Learning
# Project Overview
This project focuses on the Vanishing Gradient Problem, a critical challenge in training deep neural networks. The problem arises when gradients of the loss function become extremely small during backpropagation, hindering weight updates in earlier layers. This project explores the causes, consequences, and solutions to this problem using various techniques.

# Objective
Understand and demonstrate the Vanishing Gradient Problem using deep neural networks.
Analyze its impact on model training and performance.
Implement solutions like activation functions (ReLU), weight initialization methods, and architecture adjustments (e.g., residual connections).
# Today's Work
Built a deep neural network model to simulate the Vanishing Gradient Problem.
Observed gradient behavior across layers using a sigmoid activation function.
Tested solutions like ReLU activation and Xavier initialization to mitigate the issue.
Visualized results to compare model performance with and without solutions.
